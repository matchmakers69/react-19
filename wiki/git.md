### Cherry pick - take commit from one branch and move that to the other

### git log - will show commits from the branch i am already on

## git log nav --oneline should show commits from specific branch i want to take commit # i.e

## so i.e i can take a commit from nav branch and then being on my branch i.e main i can git cherry-pick 48484 - commit hash

## Can also cheery-pick multiple commits from nav branch i.e git cherry-pick 747585 583494
